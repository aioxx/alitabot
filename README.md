## Requirements
- You need to have a *Mongo Database* (Cluster Preferred)
- Linux/Windows machine (Ubuntu/Debain-based OS Preferred or Windows 10/Server2016 and later)


## How to setup

First Step!
- Star **‚≠ê** the repository!!

It really motivates me to continue this project further.

### Deploy to Heroku
- Get your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [here](https://my.telegram.org/)
- Get your Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

**Note:** As it is banned with an unknown reason in heroku, follow the below steps carefully!
- First Fork this repo :)
- secondly, create an empty app in the Heroku, with a custom app name; and select Europe region for faster speed.
- Now go to the deploy tab of your app and under deployment method select GitHub and connect it.
- after that, type the forked repo name and select it now select main branch and enable auto deploy, at last click on deploy now button!
- Lastly, you must fill up all the vars in heroku as directed in app.json file and now turn on the worker dyno to run it :)

### Traditional

- Install Python v3.7 or later from [Python's Website](https://python.org)
- Install virtualenv using `python3 -m pip -U install virtualenv`.
- **Fork** or Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/nullbite96/alitabot`
- Create Virtualenv using: `virtualenv venv`
- Install the requirements using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Fill in all the variables in *Development* class, not *Config* class. **Sudo, Dev, Whitelist** users are optional!!
- Change to virtualenv shell by using:
  `. venv/bin/activate` (Linux)
  `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Run the bot using `python3 -m alita`

### Docker

- Clone the repo and enter into it
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Fill in the `sample.env` file and rename it to `main.env`.
- Build the docker image using: `docker build -t alita_robot:latest .` (The dot '.' at last is necessary!)
- Run the command `docker run --env-file main.env alita_robot`


If all works well, bot should send message to the **MESSAGE_DUMP** Group!
